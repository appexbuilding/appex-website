We have successfully coordinated the complete renovation of the interior and exterior of this home, previously in original condition, to present as new, with elegant, contemporary finishes. 
Importantly, this was managed with the aim of minimising inconvenience to the residents, who were able to remain in the home for the duration of the project.  
Important elements of our work involved creating a modern layout with updated design, and the coordination of bathrooms and kitchen renovations to an exceptional standard. Other notable features include the beautiful hardwood flooring and window treatments.
