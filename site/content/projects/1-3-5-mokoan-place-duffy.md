Each of these delightful free-standing, single-level townhomes brings elegance and easy living to sought-after Duffy, which offers all of the amenities an established suburb provides.

These homes are easy to live in, situated on flat parcels of land, and easy to maintain, making them perfect for the downsizer or busy executive family.

Being in a small complex of only three, you have all the advantages of a free-standing home without the hassle of being in a packed busy development. All three are equipped with 4 bedrooms, the mains with walk-in wardrobes and ensuites, and the remainder with built-ins.

The kitchens are also impressive, each boasts a walk-in pantry, with ample storage space, and extra linen cupboards. The ovens are all 900mm, and you can choose an optional additional 600mm double oven if you’ll like to really express your home chef skills.

The bathrooms are gorgeous, and you can choose from either a light or dark colour palette to suit your personal style. Each is tiled from floor to ceiling, and the main bathrooms all boast full bathtubs, generous showers, and separate toilets.

Living and dining areas are expansive, with lots of natural light and high ceilings giving the homes a luxurious feel, and they all flow out onto alfresco dining areas, perfect for entertaining.

These homes all have those “must have” features, such as double garages with internal access, laundries with external access, double glazing, a gas hot water system, ducted heating and cooling, storage, a study area, and completed landscaping and driveways, and Unit 3 has enough external space for a pool!
